✅ Capstone Project: Movie Recommendation App
🎯 Objective
Create a responsive full-stack web application that allows users to search for movies, receive personalized recommendations, and manage their movie preferences.

🚀 Core Features Breakdown
1. 🔐 User Authentication
* Frontend (React):
o Registration and login forms
o Use axios to send credentials to backend

* Backend (Express.js):
o Secure password handling using bcrypt
o JWT-based authentication using jsonwebtoken

* Endpoints:
o POST /api/auth/register
o POST /api/auth/login
o GET /api/user/profile (protected route)

2. 🎬 Movie Discovery
* Use The Movie Database (TMDB) API:
o API Key setup
o Use endpoints like /search/movie, /movie/popular, etc.

* Frontend Features:
o Search bar (filter by title, genre, year)
o Filter/sort UI (rating, popularity)
o Movie detail modal/page (poster, overview, rating, etc.)

3. 👤 User Features

* Favorites & Watchlist:
o Users can save movies (stored in MongoDB)
o Create custom watchlist names

* Ratings & Reviews:
o Allow users to rate/review movies
o CRUD operations on reviews

* Profile Management:
